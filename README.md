## Overview

This is the Bootcamp week 3 challenge project where the portfolio layout from the [week 2 challenge](https://technoveltyco.github.io/bootcamp-week2-challenge/) will be refactored using the [Bootstrap CSS Framework (version 4)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

### The challenge

In this challenge, the portfolio layout from the [week 2 challenge](https://technoveltyco.github.io/bootcamp-week2-challenge/) will be refactored using the [Bootstrap CSS Framework (version 4)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

The final portfolio website should meet the following *Acceptance Criteria*:

1. The website include the following Bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.

      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
  
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section

      - A section displaying your work in grid. 

        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 

      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section

      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.

      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

2. The Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

3. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## My process

The boilerplate code was the final output from the [week 2 challenge repo](https://github.com/technoveltyco/bootcamp-week2-challenge), and the approach was about refactoring the HTML layout with Bootrap 4 components
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

The biggest challenge was refactoring the project cards, without using the [Bootstrap card component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/). I decided to be more ambitious and create my own responsive solution for this section, using semantic `figure` and `figcaption` to make the project pictures more accessible, and including a `hover` effect to include and scrollable contextual info of the project, while providing links to the repos and live sites of each project.

![Project card no hover](./assets/images/Screenshot%202022-12-14%20at%2017-31-41%20Technoveltyco%20__%20Web%20Developer.png)

The main code used for this snippets can be seen below:

```html
<!-- project card (highlighted) -->
<article class="container project highlighted">

  <figure class="figure">

    <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="./assets/images/02-run-buddy.jpg" alt="Run Buddy homepage sample">

    <!-- project hover info -->
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      <h3>Run Buddy</h3>

      <p>
        Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Placeat alias necessitatibus modi! Sapiente nisi optio expedita cum reprehenderit.
      </p>

      <div class="list-group">
        <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action active" 
            href="https://technoveltyco.github.io/prework-study-guide/" target="_blank">
          See Run Buddy sample <i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>
        </a>

        <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" 
            href="https://github.com/technoveltyco/prework-study-guide" target="_blank">
          Check out Run Buddy code <i class="bi bi-github"></i> <i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>
        </a>
      </div>
    </figcaption>
    <!-- end project hover info-->

  </figure>

  <div class="info">
    <h3>Run Buddy</h3>
    <h4>MERN Stack</h4>
  </div>

</article>
<!-- end project card (highlighted) -->
```

```css
#work .portfolio {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: var(--pf-columns-large);
  grid-template-rows: var(--pf-rows-large);
  grid-template-areas: 
    'main main'
    '. .'
    '. .'
    ;
}

#work .portfolio .project.highlighted {
  grid-area: main;
}

#work .portfolio .project {
  position: relative;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
}

#work .portfolio .project figure {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

#work .portfolio .project figure img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: fill;
}

#work .portfolio .project figure figcaption,
#work .portfolio .project .info {
  position: absolute;
}

#work .portfolio .project figure figcaption {
  opacity: 0;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 10;
  height: 100%;
  font-size: var(--font-size-small);
  padding: 1em;
  color: var(--light-text);
  background: var(--primary-color);
}

#work .portfolio .project:hover figure figcaption {
  opacity: 1;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

#work .portfolio .project .info {
  bottom: 15%;
  background-color: var(--secondary-color);
  padding: 10px;
}

#work .portfolio .project.highlighted .info {
  bottom: 20%;
}

#work .portfolio .project .info h3,
#work .portfolio .project .info h4 {
  color: var(--light-text);
}

#work .portfolio .project .info h3 {
  font-size: var(--font-size-large);
}

#work .portfolio .project .info h4 {
  font-size: var(--font-size-medium);
  display: inline-block;
}
```

### Continued development

Next steps wil be to iterate into a second round of UI/UX designs, including detailed user workflows for diferent screen sizes, a printer friendly version, and detailed wireframes and mockups following [Atomic Design Principles and Methodologies](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/atomic-design-principles-methodology-101/).
